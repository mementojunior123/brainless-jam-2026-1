    General thoughts:
        (14-01-2026, 20:04)
        I spent quite a lot of time on this game (as can probably be seen by the commit history).
        I estimate about 50 hours were poured into this game in a week (January 5th-11th) and I think it shows,
        especially compared to the other games I've made before (StormZ Day) that were made with less time and less experience.
        Space Brawl : ~5000 lines of code
        StormZ Day : ~3500 lines of code
        I'm quite happy about the end result and the feedback I received. I think I will get a good rating this jam,
        although there are quite a lot of other good games in this jam.
    
    Things I've done well:
        -I put more effort into sound design, which makes the overall experience feel better.
        -I made some original image assets, which, ironically, allowed me to save a bit of time.
        -The core of the game was coded very cleany and efficently, which allowed me more time to work on content.
        -I did some playtests before the start of the voting period, which allowed me tweak the difficulty and fix some bugs.
    
    Things I would've changed:
        -Difficulties would've allowed players to experience more of the game on an engaging level.
        -Put more focus on the start of the game, because that's the part of the game every player will experience.
        Getting it right is very important because most players won't play your game for very long.
        -Be a bit more dilligent with playtesting changes. I made a lot of balance changes to the alternate fires and
        didn't test them, which lead to some of the being outclassed by others.
    
    Overall I feel like I have a good shot of getting a good placement. I doubt I'm going to win because there are a lot
    of very good games.
    Even if I don't win, I think this was a good opportunity because I get to see the progress I've made since my last
    full game that I made in August 2024 (1.5 years ago!).

    My reaction to the results:

=======================
Bugs to fix:
    -Boss healthbar sometimes does not disappear properly

Balancing to do:
    -Add difficulties
    -Tune the alternate fires to be more in line with one another

Other changes:
    -Add an alternative keybind for dashing like [G]. More comfortable for players that are less experienced in video games.
